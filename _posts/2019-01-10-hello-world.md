I always wanted to start a blog, share some notes (personal or technical) and practice writing. But I wasn't sure what is the best way to start and more importantly, I could not commit to it! Once in a while I find an old document that I started to practice writing. I hope this is not yet another end of a beginning, like those old documents. This is the first time I am putting them in public.

After searching a bit for ways to maintatin a blog, I decided to start it simple, using
[Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and github pages. ~~For now, using the basic layouts and a supported
[theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker). So far, so good. I might write about the process sometime later.~~
**(Update in 2022)**: I used to use a separate repo for a blog and was using Jekyll + hacker theme, but now I've merged my personal webpages and blog into one repo and I'm using [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

I want to write both in Farsi and English. But I haven't decided whether I should put them into two separate blogs. Let's see what happens.

Hello World again and see you soon!
